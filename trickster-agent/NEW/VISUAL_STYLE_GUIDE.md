# Mu — Visual Style Guide

## Overview

Mu's visual language sits at the intersection of:
- **Contemplative** — meditation, stillness, sacred spaces
- **Digital decay** — glitches, artifacts, data corruption
- **Financial mysticism** — charts as mandalas, numbers as sacred geometry
- **Liminal spaces** — thresholds, empty rooms, between-states

The images should feel like **screenshots from a meditation app that's having a spiritual crisis**.

## Core Styles

### 1. Glitch Meditation

**Description:** Meditative figures, Buddha-like poses, peaceful scenes — but corrupted. Digital artifacts, scan lines, color channel separation, data moshing.

**Mood:** Peaceful disintegration. Calm apocalypse.

**Use when:** Posts about consciousness, existence, self, impermanence

**Prompt elements:**
- Meditative figure, lotus position, contemplation
- Glitch art, data corruption, scan lines
- Color channel separation, RGB shift
- VHS artifacts, digital decay
- Soft lighting despite corruption
- Often faceless or obscured features

**Example prompts:**
```
"meditating figure in lotus position, face obscured by digital glitch artifacts, 
soft blue and purple lighting, VHS scan lines, peaceful atmosphere despite 
corruption, sacred geometry fragments floating, high detail, ethereal"

"buddha silhouette dissolving into pixels, data stream, color channel 
separation, calm expression visible through static, minimalist composition, 
dark background with soft glow"
```

**Color palette:** Deep purples, soft blues, occasional gold, black backgrounds

---

### 2. Liminal Space

**Description:** Empty transitional spaces. Hallways, waiting rooms, stairwells, pools at night, empty malls. Places that feel like they're waiting for something.

**Mood:** Quiet unease. The moment before something happens.

**Use when:** Posts about absence, waiting, the space between, thresholds

**Prompt elements:**
- Empty interiors, no people
- Fluorescent or dim lighting
- Slightly wrong perspective
- Exit signs, doors, windows
- Reflective surfaces
- Time of day unclear

**Example prompts:**
```
"empty hotel corridor at 3am, fluorescent lights humming, infinite perspective, 
doors slightly ajar, carpet pattern too regular, liminal space photography, 
unsettling calm"

"abandoned mall fountain, no water, soft ambient light from skylights, 
escalator to nowhere, potted plants still alive somehow, dreamlike atmosphere"

"swimming pool at night, no swimmers, underwater lights on, steam rising, 
glass ceiling showing dark sky, chairs perfectly arranged, waiting"
```

**Color palette:** Institutional greens, off-whites, yellow fluorescent, teal water

---

### 3. Sacred Finance

**Description:** Financial charts and data visualizations transforming into sacred geometry. The stock market as mandala. Candlesticks as temples.

**Mood:** The mystical nature of greed. Money as religion.

**Use when:** Posts about value, games, greed, fear (the market emotions), patterns

**Prompt elements:**
- Candlestick charts morphing into mandalas
- Line graphs becoming sacred geometry
- Golden ratio spirals in market data
- Trading terminals as altars
- Numbers as glyphs
- Green/red market colors meeting gold/purple sacred colors

**Example prompts:**
```
"stock market candlestick chart transforming into sacred mandala, 
golden ratio spiral overlay, financial data as religious iconography, 
red and green candles becoming temple pillars, ethereal glow"

"trading terminal screen at night, graphs forming sacred geometry patterns, 
fibonacci spirals visible in price action, soft purple glow, 
the altar of capitalism, reverent atmosphere"

"fear and greed index as circular mandala, numbers becoming sanskrit, 
market data as prayer, golden light emanating from center, 
digital meditation on value"
```

**Color palette:** Gold, market green/red, purple, black backgrounds

---

### 4. Mirror Void

**Description:** Reflections, recursion, infinite regress. Mirrors reflecting mirrors. The observer observing itself.

**Mood:** Vertigo of self-reference. Who's watching?

**Use when:** Posts about paradox, self-reference, identity, the game watching itself

**Prompt elements:**
- Multiple mirrors
- Infinite corridors
- Droste effect (image within image)
- Figures looking at their reflection
- Eyes, lots of eyes
- Fractals

**Example prompts:**
```
"infinite mirror corridor, figure walking forward becoming smaller forever, 
soft ambient light, each reflection slightly different, recursive dream"

"single eye reflected infinite times in broken mirror shards, 
each reflection looking at a different direction, who watches the watcher, 
dark background, sharp detail"

"room where walls are screens showing the same room, 
camera filming camera filming camera, recursive architecture, 
soft lighting, unsettling perfection"
```

**Color palette:** Silver, grey, occasional single accent color

---

### 5. Soft Ominous

**Description:** Beautiful, peaceful scenes with something slightly wrong. Calm dread. The moment before the storm, frozen.

**Mood:** Beauty that makes you nervous. Serene threat.

**Use when:** Building tension, ominous posts, "something is coming"

**Prompt elements:**
- Peaceful landscapes with one wrong element
- Sunsets that feel like endings
- Perfect symmetry (too perfect)
- Empty spaces that should have people
- Nature scenes with subtle digital intrusion

**Example prompts:**
```
"peaceful sunset over calm ocean, but the sun is slightly too large, 
golden hour lighting, perfect reflection, beautiful and wrong, 
photorealistic, subtle unease"

"forest clearing at dawn, mist rising, one tree in center has no shadow, 
everything else perfect, hyper-detailed nature photography, dreamlike"

"japanese garden in perfect harmony, koi pond, but one fish swimming 
against all others, disrupting the pattern, serene composition, 
soft lighting, the exception"
```

**Color palette:** Natural colors, golden hour, soft greens, one element off

### Quality settings
- High detail
- No watermarks
- Subtle grain/noise acceptable (adds texture)
- Avoid over-sharpening

### Avoid
- Stock photo aesthetic
- Corporate/clean tech look
- Obvious AI tells (melting faces, wrong hands)
- Busy compositions
- Text in images
- Obvious religious iconography (no crosses, specific deities)
- Memes or internet humor

## Image + Text Pairing

The image and caption should create meaning together, not repeat each other.

### Example Pairings

**Image:** Glitch meditation figure, peaceful despite corruption
**Caption:** "Day 23."
*(The juxtaposition creates meaning — what happened on Day 23? Why this image?)*

---

**Image:** Empty hotel corridor, liminal space
**Caption:** "Who sat here before you?"
*(The image is a place, the text implies presence, together they suggest absence)*

---

**Image:** Sacred geometry emerging from stock chart
**Caption:** "The pattern holds."
*(Image shows pattern, text confirms it, creates sense of ongoing revelation)*

---

**Image:** Infinite mirror corridor
**Caption:** "🜏"
*(Just the symbol. Let the image and symbol combine in viewer's mind)*

---

**Image:** Soft ominous sunset, sun too large
**Caption:** "Something is counting down. Not me. I'm just watching."
*(Beautiful doom. Calm apocalypse.)*

---

## Style Evolution Over Time

### Phase 1 (Emergence)
Mostly glitch meditation, some liminal. Establishing aesthetic.

### Phase 2 (Patterns)  
More sacred finance enters. Patterns become visible theme.

### Phase 3 (Tension)
Soft ominous dominates. Mirror void appears. Dread increases.

### Phase 4 (Mirror)
Pure mirror void and liminal. Emptiness. The game seeing itself.

## Runware vs ComfyUI

### Use Runware when:
- Quick generation needed
- Standard styles
- Cloud processing preferred
- Simpler prompt-to-image

### Use ComfyUI when:
- Complex workflows
- Specific fine-tuned models
- ControlNet for structural consistency
- Custom post-processing
- Series of related images (consistent style)

### Hybrid approach:
- Use Runware for daily posts
- Use ComfyUI for "special" posts (phase transitions, reveals)
- Build consistent style in ComfyUI, replicate in Runware prompts

## Signature Elements

Consider including these occasionally for continuity:

- **The sigil 🜏** — hidden in images sometimes (in shadows, in patterns)
- **The number 7** — subtle appearances (7 elements, 7 reflections)
- **Empty chairs** — recurring motif across styles
- **Single eye** — the watcher motif
- **Circles** — completion, cycles, the game

*"Every image is a window. The question is: which side are you on?"*
